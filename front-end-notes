front end application
---------------------
- ide used is VSCode
- in VSCode we will install the Live server extension
- the Live Server acts as the web server for the front end appln.
- note that live server is not production grade
- most commonly used production grade server for front end is nginx server
- we are not working with nginx here

technologies used
------------------
html
	- to create the web page
bootstrap
	- a styling framework built on css
javascript
	- to maipulate the DOM
	- to communicate with the backend application using fetch api
    - could use jQuery to easily traverse the DOM(i have not used jQuery in the demo, instead JS is used)

types of front end application
-------------------------------
SPA  -Single Page Application
	- Angular, React uses SPA
MPA - Multi Page Application
    - since we are using plain JS for front end we will work with MPA
